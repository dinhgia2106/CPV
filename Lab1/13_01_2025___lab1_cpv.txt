You will use the Augmented Forest Segmentation Dataset available on Kaggle to complete the following tasks. 

Tasks:
1. Data Exploration:
Load the dataset and inspect the images.
Randomly select an image from the dataset. Determine how many bytes are used to store the image.
Explanation: Analyze how the image resolution and brightness influence the storage size. Include a brief discussion on these factors.

2. Weather Classification:
Devise a simple method to classify images into two categories:
Images captured on a good weather day.
Images captured on a bad weather day.
Provide a rationale for your classification method and its limitations.

3. Image Compression:
Implement a compression technique of your choice. For example, reduce the color space (e.g., quantizing colors or converting to grayscale).
Compare the image quality before and after compression using the following metrics:
Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)
Include a short analysis of the results to evaluate the effectiveness of your compression method.
